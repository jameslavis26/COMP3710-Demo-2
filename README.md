# COMP3710-Demo-2
1. Part 1: Eigenfaces
2. Part 2: CNN
Built CNN with 94% accuracy
3. Part 3: GAN
Followed the DCGAN pytorch tutorial to construct the classes and training loop. I couldnt however load the entire dataset to Rangpur due to memory contraints, hence the model was not able to be trained well.
